# 1. Print descriptions of what's happening for the player
print("hello player, this game is about..........")
# a good practice is to explain your game clearly to help players
# navigate it easly, for example
print("You find yourself in a place") # the place may be changed to add randomness
print("To escape, you have to choose your direction") # the options may be changed
print("You will have an enemy to fight") # the enemy may be changed to add randomness
print("You win if you kill the enemy")
print("You lose if the enemy killed you")
